// Question 5: Economic Analysis Long Answer
exports.course3_02_economic_environment_longAnswer = createAILongAnswer({
  prompt: `Create a long answer question about how economic conditions affect personal financial decisions for Grade 11-12 students.
    
    The question should:
    - Present a scenario with multiple economic indicators changing
    - Ask students to analyze the situation and recommend financial strategies
    - Require consideration of both short-term and long-term impacts
    - Include real-world context (e.g., planning for college, first job, etc.)
    
    Rubric should evaluate:
    1. Economic Analysis (3 points): Accurate interpretation of economic indicators
    2. Strategic Thinking (4 points): Well-reasoned financial strategies with justification
    3. Risk Consideration (2 points): Acknowledges uncertainties and trade-offs
    4. Communication (1 point): Clear, organized presentation of ideas
    
    Total: 10 points
    Word limit: 200-400 words`,

      sampleAnswer: "The economic indicators suggest we're in a late expansion phase: rising rates indicate the Federal Reserve is combating inflation, while low unemployment shows a strong job market. This creates both opportunities and challenges for financial planning. For budgeting, I'd use the 50/30/20 rule but adjust for inflation by allocating extra to needs (perhaps 55%) since costs are rising. I'd prioritize building a 6-month emergency fund in a high-yield savings account to take advantage of rising ratesâ€”if rates reach 4%, that's better than historic norms. For debt management, I'd aggressively pay down any variable-rate debt (like credit cards) since rates are rising, making this debt increasingly expensive. If I have fixed-rate student loans below 5%, I'd pay minimums since inflation is eroding the real cost of this debt. For investing, I'd start contributing to my 401(k) to get any employer match (free money), then open a Roth IRA. Given my long time horizon, I'd invest in low-cost index funds despite market volatility. The key risk is that rising rates might trigger a recession, so maintaining that emergency fund is crucial for job security concerns."
