// normalizedWords.js
// This file exports an object where each key is a word (or pattern) that you want to adjust,
// and the value is the string you want to replace it with.
// For example, if you want the TTS to spell out "AI" as "A I", add that mapping here.

module.exports = {
    // Replace "AI" with "A I"
    "AI": "A I",
    // Add more mappings as needed:
    // "Dr.": "Doctor",
    // "etc.": "et cetera"
