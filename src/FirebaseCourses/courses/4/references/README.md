# COM1255 Course Development Guide

## Course Overview
COM1255 is an orientation course for RTD Math Academy that walks students through the student handbook while covering COM1255 outcomes from the Program of Studies (POS). The goal is to make this course focused on how the outcomes apply specifically to RTD Academy courses, not just general applications.

## Design Principles

### Clean, Modern Format
- Use consistent typography hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
- Implement clean spacing between sections
- Utilize modern UI components (cards, buttons, interactive elements)
- Follow existing codebase patterns and Tailwind CSS styling
- Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes

### Content Strategy
- **RTD-Specific Focus**: Connect all content directly to RTD Academy policies and procedures
- **Student Handbook Integration**: Reference and reinforce handbook content throughout lessons
- **Practical Application**: Show how COM1255 outcomes apply in RTD's online learning environment
- **Interactive Learning**: Enhance engagement through interactive elements

### Information Gaps
- **Blank Cards**: When information is missing or needs further development, create placeholder cards with:
  - Clear titles indicating the missing content
  - Brief description of what should be included
  - Styling consistent with completed sections
  - Easy identification for later review and completion

### Interactive Elements
Consider adding these interactive components to enhance student learning:
- **Knowledge Checks**: Quick quiz questions throughout lessons
- **Scenario-Based Learning**: Real-world RTD Academy situations
- **Interactive Timelines**: For course progression and deadlines
- **Clickable Infographics**: For complex policy explanations
- **Progress Trackers**: Visual indicators of lesson completion
- **Reflection Activities**: Self-assessment and goal-setting exercises
- **Interactive Forms**: Practice filling out RTD-specific documents

## Content Structure

### Lesson Components
Each lesson should include:
1. **Learning Objectives**: Clear, measurable outcomes
2. **Introduction**: Context and relevance to RTD Academy
3. **Main Content**: Information delivery with RTD-specific examples
4. **Interactive Elements**: Engagement activities as appropriate
5. **Knowledge Check**: Assessment of understanding
6. **Summary**: Key takeaways and next steps
7. **Resources**: Links to relevant RTD policies and support

### Assessment Integration
- **AI Multiple Choice Questions**: Leverage existing assessment system
- **Real-World Scenarios**: RTD Academy-specific situations
- **Policy Application**: How students would apply policies in practice
- **Reflection Assignments**: Personal learning plans and goal setting
