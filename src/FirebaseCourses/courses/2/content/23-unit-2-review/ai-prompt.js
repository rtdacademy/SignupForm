## **UNIT 2 REVIEW LESSON CONTEXT**

Students are viewing the "Unit 2 Review - Optics and Wave Properties of Light" lesson (90 minutes) designed for exam preparation. The lesson contains:

### **Available Content Sections:**
- **Review Objectives**: What students should master by the end of Unit 2
- **Essential Formulas**: Key equations for reflection, refraction, mirrors, lenses, and interference

- **Exam Success Tips**: Step-by-step problem-solving strategy and common mistakes
- **Practice Questions**: Comprehensive set of multiple-choice review problems

### **Key Concepts Covered:**
- **Law of Reflection**: $\\theta_i = \\theta_r$ (angles measured from normal)
- **Snell's Law**: $n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2$ (refraction at interfaces)
- **Mirror/Lens Equation**: $\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i}$ (image formation)
- **Magnification**: $M = -\\frac{d_i}{d_o} = \\frac{h_i}{h_o}$ (size and orientation)
- **Double Slit Interference**: $d\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda$ (constructive interference)
- **Critical Angle**: $\\sin\\theta_c = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}$ (total internal reflection)

### **Problem-Solving Strategy:**
1. **Identify the Optics Type**: Reflection, refraction, lens/mirror, or wave interference?
2. **Draw Ray Diagrams**: Sketch the setup, mark focal points, and trace key rays
3. **Apply Sign Conventions**: Real images: negative dᵢ, Virtual images: positive dᵢ
4. **Solve and Verify**: Use appropriate formulas, check units, verify physical reasonableness

### **Common Problem Types:**
- **Reflection Problems**: Plane mirrors, curved mirrors, multiple reflections
- **Refraction & TIR**: Snell's law, critical angles, total internal reflection, prisms
- **Mirrors & Lenses**: Image formation, magnification, focal lengths, ray diagrams
- **Wave Interference**: Double slits, diffraction gratings, interference patterns
- **Polarization & Color**: Polarizing filters, electromagnetic radiation

### **Common Student Difficulties:**
1. **Sign convention errors** - Wrong signs for image distances
2. **Angle measurement confusion** - From normal vs from surface
3. **Unit conversion mistakes** - nm to m, lines/cm to lines/m
4. **Ray diagram neglect** - Not drawing diagrams to visualize problems
5. **Formula misapplication** - Using wrong equation for the problem type
6. **Physical unreasonableness** - Not checking if answers make sense

### **Exam Preparation Focus:**
- Master ray diagram construction for mirrors and lenses
- Understand and apply sign conventions correctly
- Practice unit conversions and angle measurements
- Memorize key formulas and when to use them
- Develop systematic problem-solving approach

## **Unit 2 Review Quick Reference**

### **Reflection and Refraction**
- **Law of Reflection**: $\\theta_i = \\theta_r$ (angles from normal)
- **Snell's Law**: $n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2$
- **Index of Refraction**: $n = \\frac{c}{v}$
- **Critical Angle**: $\\sin\\theta_c = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}$ (for $n_1 > n_2$)

### **Mirrors and Lenses**
- **Mirror/Lens Equation**: $\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i}$
- **Magnification**: $M = -\\frac{d_i}{d_o} = \\frac{h_i}{h_o}$

### **Wave Interference**
- **Double Slit**: $d\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda$ (constructive)
- **Diffraction Grating**: Same formula, where $d = \\frac{1}{\\text{lines per meter}}$

## **Sign Conventions**
- **Focal Length**: $f > 0$ for concave mirrors/converging lenses, $f < 0$ for convex mirrors/diverging lenses
- **Image Distance**: $d_i < 0$ for real images, $d_i > 0$ for virtual images
- **Magnification**: $M < 0$ for inverted images, $M > 0$ for upright images

## **Problem-Solving Strategy**
1. **Identify**: Type of optics problem (reflection, refraction, mirrors/lenses, interference)
2. **Draw**: Ray diagrams showing object, focal points, and image formation
3. **Apply**: Correct sign conventions and appropriate formulas
4. **Solve**: Calculate step-by-step with proper units
