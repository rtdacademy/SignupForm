      <h4>Alberta High School Diploma Requirements</h4>
      <p>To obtain an Alberta High School Diploma, students must complete specific courses and pass diploma exams, which are standardized tests for key subjects such as Math, English, Sciences, and Social Studies. These exams are mandatory and are typically written in person at designated locations within Alberta.</p>
  
      <h4>Your Pathway to a Diploma</h4>

          <strong>Registration and Alberta Student Number (ASN):</strong>

The ASN is essential for accessing your educational records and registering for diploma exams. You can manage this through your myPass account, which is the Alberta government's self-service website for students.</p>
