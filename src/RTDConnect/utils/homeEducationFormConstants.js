  // Francophone education legal text
  FRANCOPHONE_EDUCATION: `Section 23 Francophone Education Eligibility Declaration

*To be completed only if associate board is supervising Home Education Program.

Section 2 (1) of the Student Record Regulation states that:
The student record for a student or child must contain all information affecting the decisions made about the education of the student or child that is collected or maintained by a board or an private early childhood services program operator, regardless of the manner in which the student record is maintained or stored including:

(s) in the case of a student record maintained by a board, other than a person responsible for the operation of a private school, if the parent/guardian of the student or child has the right to have the student or child receive primary and secondary school instruction in the French language under section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a notation to indicate that and a notation to indicate whether the parent/guardian wishes to exercise that right.

Pursuant to Section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms:

Citizens of Canada:
• whose first language learned and still understood is French; or
• who have received their primary school instruction in Canada in French have the right to have their children receive primary and secondary instruction in French; or
• of whom any child has received or is receiving primary or secondary school instruction in French in Canada, have the right to have all their children receive primary and secondary school instruction in the same language.

In Alberta, parents/guardians can only exercise this right by enrolling their child in a French first language (Francophone) program offered by a Francophone Regional authority.`,

  // Part B Declaration text
  PART_B_DECLARATION: `I/We understand and agree that the instruction and evaluation of my/our child's progress is my/our responsibility and that the associate board or private school will supervise and evaluate my/our child's progress in accordance with the Home Education Regulation.

I/We understand and agree that the development, administration and management of the home education program is our responsibility.`,

  // Alberta Programs implications
  ALBERTA_PROGRAMS_IMPLICATIONS: `Parents/guardians who provide home education programs acknowledge that there are implications when they choose to use programs different from the Alberta Programs of Study:

1. Students may not apply to a high school principal for high school credits.
2. Students may not receive an Alberta High School Diploma.

Any student in a home education program may write a high school diploma examination. However, the diploma examination mark achieved will stand alone and will not result in a final course mark unless accompanied by a recommendation for credit by a high school principal. A final course mark requires both a school awarded mark and a diploma examination mark. Arrangements to write diploma examinations should be made well in advance of the writing date by contacting the associate school board or associate private school for assistance or Exam Administration at 780-643-9157.`,
