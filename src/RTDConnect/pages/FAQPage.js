      question: "What is parent-directed home education?",
      answer: "Parent-directed home education allows families to build personalized learning programs around each child's interests, needs, and goals. Parents (and students) choose resources, programs, and experiences that support meaningful and relevant learning.",
      icon: Users
    },
    {
      question: "Do you support different home education approaches?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Home education is not one-size-fits-all. Whether you lean toward unschooling, classical, Waldorf, Charlotte Mason, Montessori, eclectic, traditional, or something entirely your own - your approach is welcome here. What matters most is that it works for your family. We encourage flexibility and curiosity as you find your rhythm.",

      question: "Are RTD-Connect facilitators certified teachers?",

      question: "Do you provide a curriculum?",
      answer: "Curriculum choices are entirely up to the parent. While we don't prescribe a specific curriculum, we offer guidance, suggestions, and access to optional subscriptions and digital tools that can support your program. Your facilitator can help you find what suits your child's needs.",

    {
      question: "Do I need to submit a home education plan?",
      answer: "Yes. All families are required to submit a program plan that outlines your intended learning approach and goals. Our digital platform makes this easy by guiding you through a simple, step-by-step process that can be completed in just minutes when you register. You can update your plan throughout the year as your child's learning evolves, with the same user-friendly interface.",

          <p className="mt-3">That said, a diploma is not required to access post-secondary education. Many colleges, universities, and trade schools offer alternative entry routes, including:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1 mt-2">
            <li>Mature student status (usually age 19+)</li>
            <li>Open studies or non-program enrollment</li>
            <li>Portfolio-based admissions (especially in arts or design)</li>
            <li>Completion of individual high school courses for credit (online or in-person)</li>
            <li>Alberta's High School Equivalency Diploma (via adult learning centres)</li>
            <li>Direct entry into trades, apprenticeships, or certificate programs</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3">Homeschooled students often follow unique and flexible pathways. Many post-secondary institutions are increasingly supportive of non-traditional learners. Your facilitator can help you explore the best route for your child's future.</p>
